          Instituted in 2008 by the students of Delhi Public School Dwarka, COЯE
          was established with the aim of promoting competence and excellence in
          the field of computer and information technology at school, as well as
          various inter-school symposia. COЯE hosted its first Inter School
          Symposium in 2008. Since then, we have not looked back.

          Over the years, the club has progressed phenomenally, dominating
          several competitions and attaining victory. We have set high standards
          and ensure that we not only conform to these year after year, but set
          the bar a few notches higher. It takes a radical attitude, love for
          computers and an exceptional set of skills to be a part of the club.

          Web Design, Gaming, Quiz etc. The overall trophy was bagged by DPS RK
          Puram.
